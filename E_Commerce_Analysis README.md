## Overview
* The project task was to analyze raw transaction logs, create a conversion funnel to better understand how users interact with the website, and prepare cohort analysis to identify the rentention rates of its customers.
### This project shows the overall activity of multiple cohorts, over a span of (6) months
* Cohort Analysis takes a look at how the different groups purchased from the beginning and over a course of months.
* Rentention Rates measures the percentage of customers or users who continue to use a product, service, or platform over a certain period.
* Conversion Funnel helps align marketing teams with objectives and track customers through their purchasing journey.
* Cohort 0 was at 100% which should always be the case for a group of first-time purchasers. After the first cohort, cohorts (1) and (2) had a good amount of consistency with unique user engagement. Cohorts (3) and (4) had the least amount of unique user engagement. My recommendation based on cohort numbers and retention strategy is to continue to engage with users in the way cohorts 1 and 2 were interacted with to achieve similar results for the rest of the cohorts.
