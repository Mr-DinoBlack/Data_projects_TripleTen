## Overview
* The project task was to prepare an analysis for the CEO of the Superstore to help them understand what is causing customers to return their orders and how to reduce the volume of returned orders.
### This Project Shows The Root Causes of Returns, looking at total sales & total returns,customer info, maps, time of year, product category

* Returns should be measured using the average numbers of returns, and the total number of returns.
* Using different dimensions to discover more information offers more insights.
* Some root causes of returns were geographical location, time of year, and shipping mode.
* My recommendation for the next step towards taking a deeper analysis into returns should be identifying customer satisfaction in the areas with the largest, and highest returns. This will be able to create another measure such as ratings. This has the strong potential to create more insights around returns, age, demographics, etc. Customer ratings can have multiple aspects when receiving & returning the original order. Joining a new measure such as ratings with Customer ID, City, State, etc. We can continue to dive deeper into why returns are so much higher in certain areas of the United States, for which customers, and times of the year.
