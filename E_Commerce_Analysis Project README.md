## Overview
* The project task was to analyze raw transaction logs, create a conversion funnel to better understand how users interact with the website, and prepare cohort analysis to identify the rentention rates of its customers.
### This project shows the overall activity of multiple cohorts, over a span of (6) months
* Cohort Analysis takes a look at how the different groups purchased from the beginning and over a course of months.
* Rentention Rates measures the percentage of customers or users who continue to use a product, service, or platform over a certain period.
* Conversion Funnel helps align marketing teams with objectives and track customers through their purchasing journey.
* Cohort 0 was at 100% which should always be the case for a group of first-time purchasers. After the first cohort, cohorts (1) and (2) had a good amount of consistency with unique user engagement. Cohorts (3) and (4) had the least amount of unique user engagement.
* My recommendation based on cohort numbers and retention strategy is to continue to engage with users in the way cohorts 1 and 2 were interacted with to achieve similar results for the rest of the cohorts.
